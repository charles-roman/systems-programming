<summary><strong> Dynamic Memory Allocation (Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

<br>

Dynamic memory allocation grants flexibility to programs that:
- Do not know the size of arrays or other data structures until runtime (e.g. size depends on user input)
- Need to allow for a variety of input sizes (not just fixed capacity)
- Want to allocate exactly the memory needed, avoiding wasted space
- Need to grow or shrink memory usage during program execution, reallocating space as needed and freeing it when no longer used

### Characteristics of Dynamically Allocated Memory
- Dynamically allocated memory resides in the **heap** region of a program‚Äôs address space.
- When memory is allocated at runtime, the heap returns a **pointer** to the start of that memory block.
- Heap memory is **anonymous** ‚Äî addresses are not tied to named variables.
  - For example, a local pointer on the stack can point to a block of memory in the heap.
- Heap memory must be **explicitly allocated and deallocated** by the programmer.
  - Failure to do so can result in **memory leaks**.
- Dynamic memory can be used to allocate [arrays](#arrays) as well:
  - The returned pointer is the **base address** of the array.
  - You can use the memory just like a statically declared array.
  - Functions receiving dynamically or statically allocated arrays treat them the same.
    - By convention, **pointer syntax** is preferred for dynamically allocated arrays.

## Heap Memory Management
C provides `malloc()` and `free()` as the interface to manage heap memory:

- The **heap manager** maintains a **free list** ‚Äî a set of unallocated memory extents.
- Each **extent** represents a contiguous chunk of free memory with a start address and size.
- Initially, all heap memory is free.
- **Repeated calls** to `malloc()` and `free()` may lead to **fragmentation** of heap memory.
- The manager uses the free list to:
  - Track available memory regions
  - Locate suitable contiguous blocks to fulfill future `malloc()` requests

### Memory Metadata
- When you call `malloc()`, the heap manager also allocates a few bytes **before** the memory block to store **metadata**.
- This metadata includes information such as the **size** of the allocated block.
- This is why `free()` does **not** require the size of the memory ‚Äî it retrieves it from the hidden header.

### üîë Key Functions
| Function     | Description                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `malloc()`   | Allocates a block of memory                      |
| `calloc()`   | Allocates and zero-initializes memory            |
| `realloc()`  | Resizes previously allocated memory              |
| `free()`     | Frees allocated memory                           |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Always `free()` any memory allocated with `malloc()` or `calloc()` to prevent memory leaks.

<summary><strong> Arrays (Click to Expand)</strong></summary>

<br>

Arrays provide **contiguous storage** of elements of the **same data type**. They can be allocated either statically or dynamically depending on the needs of the program.

---

### Static Arrays
- **Statically declared arrays** are allocated:
  - On the **stack** if declared as local variables.
  - In the **data segment** if declared as global or static variables.
- Their **capacity must be known at compile time**.

---

### Dynamic Arrays
- Allocated on the **heap** at runtime using `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc`.
- Can be **resized** by allocating new memory and copying elements.
- Used when:
  - The array size is unknown at compile time.
  - You need to support **variable-length input**.
  - Memory usage needs to be more efficient.

---

### Arrays in Functions
- In C, when passing an array to a function, the array **decays** to a pointer.
  - Only the **base address** of the array is passed.
  - The parameter and argument both refer to the **same memory**.
- This means:
  - **Modifications** to the array in the function will affect the original array.
  - Semantics are identical to **pointer-based** parameter passing.

---

### 2D Arrays

#### Static 2D Arrays
- **Statically allocated 2D arrays** are stored in **row-major order**:
  - Each row is a 1D array stored **contiguously** in memory.
  - Rows are placed one after the other in memory.
- Passing a 2D array to a function works the same as with 1D arrays:
  - The parameter receives the **base address** of the matrix.
  - Indexing remains consistent and predictable.

#### Dynamic 2D Arrays
There are two common ways to dynamically allocate a 2D array:

---

#### 1. Single Block Allocation

- Allocate **one large contiguous block** of `N * M` elements.
- Use pointer arithmetic to map 2D indices to 1D memory:
  ```c
  arr[i * M + j]

  > ‚ö†Ô∏è Syntactically, this is no different than allocation for a 1D array which prevents the compiler from being able to differentiate between the two; this is what causes the need for indexing logic

**Advantages:**
- Memory and cache efficient.
- Entire matrix is stored contiguously.
- Fast access due to spatial locality.

**Disadvantages:**
- Less intuitive syntax.
- Requires manual indexing logic.

#### 2. Array of Row Pointers

- Allocate a 1D array of N pointers, where each pointer points to a 1D array of M values.
- This provides more programmer-friendly syntax, allowing for use of matrix-style notation (`arr[][]`).

**Advantages:**
- Natural, intuitive matrix syntax.
- Easier to work with in code and debugging.

**Disadvantages:**
- Only the elements within each row are contiguous.
    - Consecutive rows may not be adjacent in memory.
- Less efficient in memory usage and access time due to fragmentation.
